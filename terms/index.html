						operation.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 0cm;margin-left: 50pt;">However, the game service can be suspended, specifying it on the official website
						30 (thirty) days in advance in case it is predicted that all of the game services will be suspended according to the
						Company&apos;s technical and operational needs (A user can be notified afterwards in case it is unavoidable to notify in
						advance).</p>
					<p><strong>2)</strong> The Company may issue a warning, suspend a user&apos;s account, or terminate the contract in case a user
						violates his/her obligations specified in the terms (Article 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, etc.), the matters specified in the service
						operation policy, or intentionally or accidentally damages the Company. In such a case, the Company, in principle, notifies in
						advance the user who has committed the violation and decides to issue a warning, adjust provisional suspension of the service
						use, or terminate the contract after weighing the gravity of a violation. In addition, such restrictions on use of the service
						may include adjustments or restrictions on use of characters, game items, and paid/free services in the user&apos;s account
						and the Company will not compensate him/her for any loss of in-game asset data including service contents, etc. such as
						certificates and points.</p>

						a user violates his/her obligations specified in the terms (Article 13, 19, 20, 21 etc.), the matters specified in the service
						operation policy, or intentionally or accidentally damages the Company, and the data loss caused by inability to continuously
						maintain in-game asset data in the game (Game items/contents that require constant maintenance, such as housing), etc. may
						occur. In such a case, the Company will not compensate the user for any damages.</p>
					<p><strong>4)</strong> The Company may terminate the contract immediately or temporarily suspend the service use without prior
						warning in case of:</p>
					<p>1. Identity/payment theft, provision of illegal programs in violation of the intellectual property laws in the country of
						service, interference with service operation, illegal communication and hacking, distribution of malicious programs, excessive
						access rights, mediation/purchase of game money, etc.</p>
					<p>2. Operator impersonation, in-game fraud, repeated bug exploitation, etc.</p>
					<p>3. Significant violations that make it difficult to restore service operation.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 0cm;margin-left: 50pt;">The obtained game items, game money, in-game asset data, characters, and other
						benefits from use of the service will be extinguished and deleted in case the contract is terminated according to the article.
						The Company will not compensate the user in any form in case of loss of in-game asset data related to this.</p>
					<p><strong>5)</strong> An account can be restricted to be used to maintain order of the games in case:</p>

						user within 15 (fifteen) days of receiving the objection. The user is notified of the reason and the processing schedule in

						contract.</p>
					<p><strong>8)</strong> The Company may temporarily restrict a user&apos;s account during the investigation according to the
						policies and it may last until the investigation is completed. The Company extends the service period of the paid service user
						(a user paying a certain amount to use the service) for as long as the service has been suspended after the investigation is
						completed in case he/she is found not to violate the policies according to the investigation. However, it does not apply to

						the user using the same payment method the user used. If the refund is not possible in the same way as the payment, it will be
						notified in advance. If the overpaid payment amount resulted from the Company&rsquo;s mistake, it will be refunded regardless
						of contract costs and fees. If the overpaid amount was the user&rsquo;s fault, the user will be liable for fees arising from
						refund processing within reasonable limits.</p>

						item, actions may be taken accordingly.</p>
					<p><strong>5)</strong> If the Company notifies the refund policy for products/services (hereinafter&nbsp;&ldquo;Refund
						Policy&rdquo;) separately, the Refund Policy takes precedence over these Terms of Service. If there is a refund policy that
						applies only to the product with a reasonable reason at the time of products/services sales(or at the time of product
						renewal), the user will be notified separately or asked for consent.</p>
					<p><strong>6)</strong> If the Company has separately notified the formula for calculating refund through the details such as event
						regulations, announcements, notices when holding events(such as package product promotion(event), product discount
						promotion(event), etc.) or renewing products due to the improvement of the game system, it will be followed. However, if there
						is no particular provision about the formula for calculating refund in the details of the service, the total amount paid by
						the user will be refunded.</p>
					<p><strong>7)</strong> If the Company limits the service use or reviews the cancellation of the contract of a specific user who is
						determined to have committed an illegal act or have committed an act of using software that is strictly prohibited by these
						Terms of Service, the Company may refuse a refund of the remaining service fees at the relevant time considering loss and
						damage caused by the user&rsquo;s violation to the services. In such a case, the Company shall inform the relevant user of
						such fact and ways to raise objections and explain via electronic documents on the website or e-mail and if the user
						reasonably explains that he/she did not committed an illegal act to the Company, this provision shall not apply.</p>
